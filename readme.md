# Learning C

My first steps in writing C code. I am writing these for my own benefit and
reference as I learn to use C.

## Build and run

Run `make`.

Binaries are output in `bin/`.

## The Exercises

Code is stored in the `src/` directory. Each subdirectory of `src/` is a
separate exercise.

The exercises implemented here are just some common tasks
that I would perform in other languages (i.e. Go, python, etc).

I hope to make these implementations as correct, efficient, and safe as
possible.
